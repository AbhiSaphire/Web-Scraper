## Download-Listen-MP3 (Pending)

This web scraper asks for a song name and searches it on www.mp3download.center (you can change this to your prefered website).
I just personally found this easier beacuse of thier lose div class names. After that software responds with top 5 results and user have to choose which one to download OR listen to.

## How To Run
<li>install pip3</li>
