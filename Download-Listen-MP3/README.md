## Download-Listen-MP3

This web scraper asks for a song name and searches it on www.mp3download.center (you can change this to your prefered website).
I just personally found this easier beacuse of thier lose class names. After that software responds with top 5 results and user have to 
choose which one to download OR listen to.

## How To Run
<li>install pip3</li> 
<b> sudo apt install python3-pip </b>
<li>install bs4 module</li> 
<b>pip3 install bs4 </b>
<li>compile and run</li> 
<b>python3 songScraper.py</b>

## Enjoy
